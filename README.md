# Classification on fashion-MNIST database using VGGnet-like architecture

## Purpose
We want to classify the pictures of fashion MNIST database at least with 85 % accuracy. Fashion-MNIST is a dataset of [Zalando](https://jobs.zalando.com/en/tech/?gh_src=22377bdd1us)'s article images—consisting of a training set of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000 examples. Each example is a 28x28 grayscale image, associated with a label from 10 classes.

## System architecture
We want to implement a VGGnet-like architecture using PyTorch machine learning framework. It contains convolutional, max-pooling and dropout layers.

## Contribution of group members
Benjámin Kispál: Implementation of the network, and the optimization part. Levente Maucha: load and preprocess the data. But we mainly work together, and discuss the upcoming problems.
